   **Published:** Fri, 05 Jul 2024 05:18:46 GMT  
   **Summary:** Data standardization is crucial for transforming raw data from diverse sources into a common format, ensuring consistency, reducing errors, and enhancing usability. A config-driven approach to data standardization uses configuration files to define rules and mappings, decoupling standardization logic from application code. This approach offers flexibility, scalability, and maintainability, making it ideal for handling large datasets and simplifying maintenance and updates.
